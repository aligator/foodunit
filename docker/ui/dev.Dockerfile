# FoodUnit 3 UI image (Dev version)
#
# The actual source files will be gathered by creating a volume that
# maps the host's ui directory against the container's /app directory:
# $ docker run -v ${pwd}/ui:/app ...

FROM node:12.2.0-alpine

RUN mkdir -p /app
WORKDIR /app

# PATH overrides the default PATH value.
ENV PATH "/app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

# Copy package.json into the app directory.
COPY package.json /app/package.json
# Install all UI dependencies.
RUN npm install
RUN npm install -g react-scripts@3.0.1

# Start the UI.
CMD ["npm", "start"]
